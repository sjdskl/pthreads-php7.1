* @NOTE
*	RESOURCES ARE BEING TRIED OUT, THIS MAY CRASH OR KILL THE EXECUTOR OF THE SCRIPT: NOT MY FAULT
*
*	It's pretty clear that people want resources to work, and I cannot deny it would be useful.
*	Officially, resources are unsupported, if it doesn't work there is NOTHING I can do about it.
*	I do NOT have the time to make every kind of resource safe, or ensure compatibility.
*	I can apply some cleverness to make sure resources are destroyed by whoever creates them, that is ALL.
*	In the case of sockets, this appears to work, the code below ran all day on pthreads.org without interruption.
*	AGAIN: 	If this does not work, there is NOTHING more I can do. 
			If a particular type of resource wigs out, there is NOTHING I can do.
			If this kills you, horribly, there is NOTHING I can do.
